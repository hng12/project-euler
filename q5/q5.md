It looks like I don't need code to do this so I'll just do it in md.

Numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

Then remove numbers which are multiples/products of each other.

Unique_numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19

Smallest number = 1\*2\*3\*4\*5\*6\*7\*11\*13\*17\*19
